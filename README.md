# React + Vite + Tailwind Initial setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite alongside tailwind installed.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- Go to package.json and package-lock.json to edit the package name
- {
  "name": "YOUR PROJECT NAME",
  "private": true ....
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
